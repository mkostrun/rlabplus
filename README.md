# RLAB3/RLABPLUS

**_RLaB3_** is an interactive, interpreted scientific programming environment for Linux operating system. 
It allows fast prototyping and script development. 
Its syntax is a combination of c (curly brackets for blocks of statement, some statements) and M**LAB and fortran (e.g., indexing of arrays starts from 1).

The project **_RLaB3_** provides a syntax update with some internal and organizational changes compared to [**_RLaB2_**](https://rlab.sourceforge.net), as developed by Ian Searle.
The project **_RLABPLUS_** adds large number of solvers, input/output operations, and visualization features and connections to other specialized software.
The projects support 32- and 64-bit linux systems, for AMD, Intel and arm/RaspberryPi.
