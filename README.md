# RLAB3/RLABPLUS

**_RLaB3_** is an interactive, interpreted scientific programming environment for Linux operating system. 
It allows fast prototyping and script development. 
Its syntax is a combination of c (curly brackets for blocks of statement, some statements) and M**LAB and fortran (e.g., indexing of arrays starts from 1).
The project 
[**_RLaB3_**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rlabplus) 
provides a syntax update with some internal and organizational changes compared to 
[**_RLaB2_**](https://rlab.sourceforge.net), as developed by Ian Searle.
The projects support 32- and 64-bit linux systems, for AMD, Intel and arm/RaspberryPi.

The project **_RLABPLUS_** adds large number of solvers, input/output operations, and visualization features and connections to other specialized software,
if form of shared object libraries.
Basically, the solvers within the project are aimed at narrow technical field, and might not be of interest to wide audiences. 
For that reason, these solvers were not incorporated into **_RLaB3_** but are, so to speak, free standing.

The project comprise the following solver libraries:

- _gpib_ - GPIB (Hewlett-Packard's General Purpose Interface Bus, for those who still use it and remember it)
for hardware and instrumentation control
